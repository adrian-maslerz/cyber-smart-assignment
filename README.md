# Cyber Smart Assignment

## What I would to if I had more time?
- Assignment contains only few tests, so I would complete missing unit tests to enhance tests coverage
- I would add error handling
- I would add and configure prettier and eslint to maintain code formatting and organization
- I would check options to optimize performance eg. by using useMemo hook

## Available Scripts

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
